## What is cssh.py?
This script should help you to manage your hosts over ssh

## What is required?
python - to run the script 
ssh - for the network
screen - for the session on the host

## How cssh.py works:
At first it reads ~/.ssh/config (line 12).
The script lists all available hosts. You are now able to connect to one.

## How you can use cssh.py:
Typ in the hostname or the number in front of it to connect to the host. When the connection is closed you are back in the python script.

## How you can exit the script:
Typ in exit or try CTRL+C or CTRL+D

## Nice to know:
Don't call a host exit ;-)
Be fair, it's my first try with python
